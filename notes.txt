- fully interpreted, stack based language
- instructions: pushnum, pushvar, popvar, add, print, etc.
- blocks: `if`. `while` and `for` coming soon

ideas:
- keep track of what pushed each value onto the stack for debuggering

todo:
- fix TODO comments
- ~~subroutine reading doesnt really need to go on the block stack, make the subroutine state its own thing~~
- make nice functions
	- `is_reading_subroutine()`
	- `goto(int loc)`
- make value_t not just an int (ie add strings)
- better error stuff. not just `printf("gah! info"); exit(1);`
	- stack trace
- reorganize stuff
